14,I am strongly opposed to the creation of a bike lane on division.,-0.6,0.6

22,Having more space to bike or simply have a lane to bike safely is one of the things I most like about living in Ann Arbor. I'm close enough to downtown to use my bike for almost every trip I do to downtown. I have a 3-year old son and he loves biking too,0.8,2.4

29,I'm a fairly strong cyclist and ride Ann Arbor streets for exercise. If I was a bike commuter I think I would love these changes. But for the way I ride they generally hem me in. But I know that more infrastructure causes more driver awareness and care.,0.2,1.7

37,Please tell me how either sitting in backed up traffic for 15 more min per day at idle while no one is in the closed lane is healthy. Or how the alternative to drive 4 extra miles to commute is helping the zero emissions?????????,-0.4,0.9
38,This is the most ridiculous project I've seen from this City. Closing down the side streets is stupid but limiting packard motor traffic from Platt to Eisenhower IS just insane.,-0.7,1.5
39,"It is a bit confusing to go from a normal nike lane from Miller and transfer to a separated, double bike lane when coming into town. It goes against what a normal bike path (going with traffic) looks and feels like.",-0.3,0.7
40,if you have two way traffic in the bike lanes then you aren't allowing for distancing. Runners/walkers/ bikes are all crammed into one area,-0.6,1.2

43,It makes a huge difference to have that little bit of extra space while on a bike. Much safer,0.9,1.8

51,"My major pain point of cycling in Ann Arbor is Packard St, between Eisenhower and Platt. The sidewalks in this area are narrow and very bumpy, cracked, and often have people walking. The new (temporary) lane of traffic for cycling this section is amazing!",-0.1,2.3

53,"I have a family with small children, and the Pilot Projects allow us to commute/ride downtown with much less stress. It increases how often we get out biking as a result.",0.4,0.8
54,These are wonderful repurposing/additions to each of the streets! Please continue this great work!,0.9,1.9

57,"I walk and bike---it feels good that the City is prioritizing this mode of transportation, particularly with this current need for social distancing.",0.8,0.8

59,"I really like the idea of expanding bike infrastructure, and of 2-way protected bikeways. That said, some of the current routes do not feel like an improvement. eg. Division/Broadway bridge - the N end is very confusing, as is Huron St crossing",-0.1,2.6

61,"As a born and raised Ann Arborite, the Packard from Eisenhower to Platt NEEDS TO GO AWAY",-0.5,0.5
62,"Cars drive so much slower now, it feels so much safer, less noisy, and way less scary to bike. Heading south on Division, cars used to head 40-50mph consistently, now they are moving closer to 30-35mph, which is much much better.",0.8,1.6

75,All this does is make it harder to get anywhere and make drivers angry. This is the stupidest idea you idiots have ever come up with.,-0.8,1.7
76,"Makes no sense to wedge bike lanes in with car lanes. Distracted drivers next to vulnerable cyclists. Now, drivers are slowed, inconvenienced and angry -- even more dangerous for cyclists. Keep cars & bikes entirely separate!",-0.5,2.7

79,"There should be better signage for the pilot / temp lanes so cyclists & pedestrians know to use them and drivers know NOT to use them. I didn't even know what they were until a friend told me, I had assumed they were blocked off for construction.",-0.7,1.4
80,I like that there's more of a physical barrier for bikes instead of a standard bike lane.,0.9,0.9
81,Nobody uses these and they are making an insane amount of traffic in Ann Arbor.,-0.8,0.8
82,"I feel so much safer not having to ride in traffic. This is especially true for my girlfriend, who is just learning to ride a bike. Having protected bike lanes makes her comfortable enough to ride downtown. Now we can bike downtown instead of driving.",0.9,3.7
83,Less fear of cars,0.5,0.5
84,I haven't been biking very much because I'm working remotely. But I know that Division/Broadway is one of the parts of my bike commute that normally makes me think twice about biking--it's normally so unsafe.,-0.4,0.9
85,"The pilot project which I have only seen while driving makes downtown so much friendlier for visitors, and as a commuter who currently only uses an automobile, I welcome any reduction in the auto traffic by making alternative transport easy is welcome",0.9,0.9
86,"I havenÂ’t been especially concerned about physical distancing when IÂ’m on my bike, but I definitely like having space to ride separate from the cars. It makes me feel confident riding with my family. Route on Packard from Platt to Eisenhower is awesome",0.9,2.8
87,don't feel safe walking or biking despite extra space when it involves high volume multiple lane roads. Separate bike paths and wider sidewalks are better in my opinion,-0.4,0.9
88,"It's just stupid. Anyone with a brain can handle distancing, and the loss of driving lanes and parking is horrible.",-0.8,1.7
89,The section along Packard from Eisenhower to Platt is totally not needed. What a waste of time and money. The closure of two lanes has backed up traffic significantly.,-0.6,2.0
90,Senseless and expensive,-0.8,0.8
91,I drive,0.1,0.1

94,It makes things downtown so much harder. End this project.,-0.2,0.4
95,Personally I donÂ’t feel that these changes a of real significance in the Covid response and end up complicating traffic. I donÂ’t feel the potential benefit is worth the cost both monetary and ergonomically,-0.6,1.3
96,"This project might be a good idea but from what I know, bicyclist don't use the bike lanes installed along William street. I travel that area and have not seen cyclists using them.",-0.3,0.7
97,This program is intrusive and unnecessary.,-0.8,0.8

104,"I feel much more secure. Having cars whiz by your knee caps, and breathing exhaust, while walking, biking or just sitting on a patio is very disconcerting, dangerous, and a huge deterrent for me walking downtown and frequenting businesses.",0.1,1.6
105,Division is the only free flowing northbound artery in town. Constricting it to a single lane is asinine. A major accident on US23 will shut down Ply/Broad/Div all the way to Hill with ripples back to A2Saline/I94. End this insanity!,-0.3,1.4
106,Packard between Eisenhower and Platt is ridiculous. The sidewalks offer enough room for social distancing and the barricades every 1/4 mile or so make it hard to bike between them and the curb.,-0.7,1.4
107,It feels a lot safer to ride your bike in and not get doored or hit my a distracted driver,0.9,0.9
108,The bike lanes make me feel significantly safer biking to/through town.,0.9,0.9
109,This was a stupid idea,-0.8,0.8
110,"I love that the city is doing this and demonstrating its commitment to safer, pedestrian- and bike-friendly spaces in downtown. Ann Arbor is called Tree Town for a reason!",0.5,1.0
111,The Eisenhower to Platt closure makes no sense. This is not a high traffic area for bikes and pedestrians. However it is for cars. And now itÂ’s congested and frustrating for drivers. The downtown ones are good and the dedicated bike lanes are great.,-0.3,3.2
112,"It's hard to maintain distance when sidewalks are crowded, these ameliorate this issue.",-0.7,0.7
113,Driving lanes in downtown Ann Arbor are tight. Having more distance certainly makes me less weary of being hit.,0.2,1.4
114,"The closures of the downtown core streets to allow restaurants to move tables into the street have been great. Makes me feel much safer, and more willing to come out and support our downtown eateries!",0.7,1.4

120,More traffic backups + short lights = angry drivers. I've already witnessed drivers blowing through intersections with peds walking because they're trying to beat the ridiculously short lights.,-0.7,1.5
121,"Having a space without cars is safer, therefore, I can feel more comfortable.",0.9,0.9
122,The Packard Road closure serves no purpose. It is not helpful to anyone. It appears to be government micromanaging the ability for citizens to exercise their personal responsibility. It is governmental over reach.,-0.6,2.7
123,"The targets for this project - for me - arent large enough to make a big, safe difference. The major streets I use to commute - main, 7th, plymouth RD - are unsafe for social distancing and biking.",-0.3,0.7
124,With only 2 lanes....creates too much traffic and I feel more unsafe,-0.8,0.8
125,"Division in particular was always blocked by delivery trucks, and AAPD refused to enforce the bike lane",-0.7,0.7
126,It is very very very nice to have a physical separation between cars. Makes biking feel significantly safer,0.9,1.9
127,I feel much better protected from cars and the project allows me to enjoy more recreational activities at a safe distance from other pedestrians/cyclists.,0.9,0.9
128,This project is a great idea but feels unevenly executed. Some cones are haphazardly placed in the middle of the lanes. (Maybe after being hit by cars?) Amazon trucks park in the lanes.,-0.5,2.1
129,"there was never a ""straight shot"" way into town from the northside, so this seems useful. I would never had rode this street before.",0.5,1.0
130,Packard from platt to Eisenhower needs a bike lane. There is no easy and direct route downtown from the east side of town and beyond.,0.0,0.3
