1,I think the city should close the streets as they are doing for more outdoor restaurant space every May-October not just during Covid. Summer outdoor dining is wonderful. Dining outside on Main Street with traffic and trucks is not a pleasant experience.,-0.1,2.4
2,"While I think this whole project is well-intended, I fear that we're wasting money and time on projects that will actually have more negative effect than positives. I'm a big bicycling fan, but we need to fix the existing paths before beginning anything new. Plus, the byproduct automotive traffic congestion will be outrageous, I can't imagine what Main St. at Stadium will be like during rush hour. Great intentions, but typically misguided here in A2.",-0.6,2.4
3,Big fan!! I dream of the day when these are made permanent. Riding through what is completed of Division just now felt revolutionary in terms of how safe and comfortable I felt compared to my normal rides on this road. I really hope that I dont get harassed by drivers parking in bike lanes or otherwise messing this up!,0.5,3.2
4,"Catherine St is a residential street with paid residential parking permits to allow people that live here to have somewhere to park. While the scheme I'm sure will have benefits, what consultation or allowances are given to people that live in the immediately affected areas to ensure this doesn't push out more residents from downtown. Residential parking bays have been recently eroded and replaced by paid meters on this street. Are we being squeezed out of Kerrytown/Old 4th?",-0.2,0.9

7,Your anti-car bias is evident.,-0.8,0.8
8,would love these to be permanent and clearer for drivers to understand so they dont park in them etc. Would be nice if there was a welcome sign or something on the north side of the broadway bridge bc it's not obvious that the barrels are for a 2 way bikeway and i saw ppl still riding on the sidewalk,-0.1,0.2
9,"This is a wonderful project! Ann Arbor is sorely lacking bike infrastructure and these pilot lanes will go a long way to improve that if they are made permanent. It has drawn my attention to a few things that make Ann Arbor still a difficult city to ride a bike in. Many of the roads in Ann Arbor are filled with potholes or poorly done patches. It's one thing to go over a pothole in car, but I almost feel like I need to trade in my bike for a mountain bike the roads are so bad. Drivers in Ann Arbor also seem very unused to having to share the road with bicyclists compared to other places I've lived and I would like to see a bigger education project around that.",-0.1,4.2

20,Thanks for all your work. This is a great effort. Promoting a landscape that welcomes all modes of transportation is equitable and fair and the right thing to do. Automobiles and their massive infrastructure greatly dominate our lives. You are helping to bring some balance.,0.8,4.2
21,the plan is too drastic for the bike use overall,-0.8,0.8
22,"My family hopes that these changes will be permanent, as they have improved our quality of life.",0.8,0.8
23,MORE SPACE FOR PEOPLE (and bikes and buses) AND LESS SPACE FOR CARS! Reconfiguring downtown to be a place that is friendly to the folks who live there and folks who commute in on bikes or on the bus is ESSENTIAL. It will make downtown safer and discourage folks from driving to and around downtown unneccesarily.,0.4,1.2
24,The closure from Packard from Eisenhower to platt has created additional traffic in the nearby neighborhoods due to people trying to escape the massive traffic logjam. This may have been fine during the Covid lockdown but traffic is back to near pre-Covid levels after the university classes started. Please end this experiment before a child is injured due to angry driver speeding in the neighborhoods.,-0.5,1.6
25,"The results of these pilots have been universally positive in my opinion, allowing for safer pedestrian travel and a much more pleasant downtown (the street closures are another positive and should be expanded). Really, the city should look at the general results of these pilots and consider making many of our downtown streets transit/bike malls. There's no reason cars should be treating certain down downtown streets as through-streets/arterials (always trying to kill all the students crossing N State it seems). The argument against this always seems to come from people who want street parking downtown, something which should really be removed in most cases. We have ramps for that purpose, and it's a high cost for the rest of us to pay for someone's minor inconvenience.",-0.2,3.1
26,Make more areas walkable!,0.4,0.4
27,Why do you think that the fairies and gnomes can just make cars going away????? All this is doing to Main street is forcing traffic into neighborhoods. Actually get out of your cushy loft apartments and see the chaos your are creating. Much like your pedestrian killer crosswalks,-0.4,2.3

31,"this is a ridiculous and expensive project. traffic is already backed up - we don't need further reduction in traffic lanes and narrowing of streets. we can't take aata right now and not everyone can walk or bike. in addition, the changes are confusing to drivers. bikers should not have to use the streets - give them a separate path off the roads.",-0.6,3.2

33,These are great!!! All for more -- and for making them permanent!,0.9,1.9
34,"It is the Tour de France bicycle race now. They have a phrase they use a lot: Traffic Furniture. It means all those things that are impeding the cyclists in the roads: curbs in the middle, pedestal signs in the middle of the roads, etc etc. You are on the way to compete with the French countryside in Traffic Furniture. North Fifth Avenue is a classic case, there by Kerrytown. I understand you have done the same to South First Street. At least your STOP flaps re removable for the winter months but these curbs are not. I can hope for another winter with hardly any snow.",0.0,1.2
35,"This is fabulous and I'm so happy the city is doing these pilot projects. Division Street in particular feels so much safer and less of a thoroughfare where cars go 45 mph from Huron to the Broadway Bridge. Thanks very much to all the folks who were part of getting this together, I really appreciate it.",0.9,2.8
36,"Traffic on Main St. from the Stadium an on is awful. That is the main road in and out of campus and you all decided to go down to one lane? Traffic was already worse enough as it was when it was 2 lanes. Sat there for over 45 minutes the other day trying to get out to Ann Arbor Saline Rd. Now with all the projects and ""Healthy Streets"" you've got going on, nothing is worth coming into Ann Arbor anymore. Will be going somewhere else where I can actually get around the town.",-0.7,4.5
37,"These projects have increased accessibility for our family with children, and allow us to travel by bike as a family more often. This also increases our use of and purchases from small businesses in the downtown area. We live off of Packard and Platt, and have witnesses many accidents impacting pedestrians/bicyclists and are grateful for the pilot project which will hopefully also help to slow wildly speeding traffic that puts our children, pets, pedestrians, etc. in danger.",0.9,2.8
38,"For the entry/exit zone at the north end of division's bike lane, it would be really advantageous to configure better signaling to the bike lane. As I write this, the paint lines have not yet been extended beyond only the southern portion of the bridge demarcating the bike lane. On another note, please remove the cones on the center lines (in the middle of the bike lane(s) - these are more hazardous than helpful to bikers/pedestrians. All-in-all, I really hope these lanes and initiatives continue in AA and are able to expand further. Thank you for making the streets for people!!!",0.2,3.2
39,Please get rid of these traffic obstacles. There is plenty of room for biking and walking without the need to create More obstacles for drivers.,0.0,1.3
40,"I do not use these streets to walk or bike. Like hundreds (thousands?) of others, I regularly drive. I am most concerned about the lane reductions on Packard, from Eisenhower to Platt. This is a busy stretch of road in a largely commercial area. To reduce traffic to one lane in each direction is ridiculous and, in my view, hazardous. I just spent 4 changes of traffic signals to get through the Packard/Platt intersection. I witnessed several near misses as frustrated drivers attempted to ""jump the line."" For someone like me, who lives near the intersection of Packard and Stadium, I will now take residential streets next time I go to shopping areas on Carpenter Road, as I witnessed others doing today. Is this the intent of the closure? PLEASE RETHINK THIS DECISION!!!",-0.3,3.4
41,"I would eliminate completely. I do not see anyone using. Almost all people I have spoken to dont like it. Im know there was good intentions but it really missed the mark. Im a business owner. People love weekend Street closures, nothing but favorable comments regarding that. In fact almost all people say it should be expanded more days.",-0.4,3.8
42,"This was a nice idea, but I haven't seen anyone using them. I think the 'if you build it they will come' mentality did NOT work for this. I also think the implementation was bad. Sorry Ann Arbor, better luck next time. Not all ideas or pilots will work. Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Cut your losses and try something else!!",-0.6,4.6
43,"This wont matter. The Mayor and his cronies have declared this to be the way. No one cares about anybody. Keep shutting down roads. Keep running unfilled, overweight buses which our roads werent designed for. Keep the city center happy, screw the working neighborhoods. I have lived here all my life. I always vote democratic and lean liberal, but Ann Arbor has gone to far, no idea to stupid or dumb. Lets just keep focusing on pet projects. Add more, so you can take care of less. Roads are crumbling, sewage back ups, street flooding, inadequate equipment/funding for snow removal, outrageous housing costs. But well have bike lanes. How are you going to maintain these? Hire more worker? Buy more equipment? Where will the increased costs come from?",-0.2,6.8
44,Get rid of the Packard one between Platt and Eisenhower. You people are going overboard,-0.8,1.6
45,"The protected bike lanes are AWESOME. It makes it so much safer, slows traffic way down, and is fun to use. For the first time ever it feels like we have a real bike network to get around the city. We need more of these, and they need to be permanent! We must move into the future where cars are not the primary mode of transportation.",0.5,3.6

48,Thank you very much for your work and thoughtfulness in this.,0.9,0.9
49,Why was broadway taken down to one lane on the bridge going east? This has made cars back up during peak travel times. I cant imagine if we were not in a pandemic what traffic would be like or even worse on a football Saturday. The Division area is a mess and confusing.,-0.5,2.3
50,"Blocking the lane on Swift today has put me over the edge as I commute from the Northside neighborhood through town to work on the south side and back each day. Traffic already backs up along Pontiac Trail while waiting for the traffic light to change. I see almost no cyclists using any of the blocked lanes as I travel through town. The Longshore slow street is completely ineffective with one sign at the canoe livery that was facing the wrong direction the last time we walked past and nothing else farther into the neighborhood. It stops/slows nothing. Flashing traffic lights forcing four way stops at busy intersections impede traffic. Does anyone even use the Washington bike lane except cars that get confused and drive down it? Please stop. When I walk downtown, I use existing sidewalks and don't have a problem sharing them with cyclists who are uncomfortable with bike lanes. Please don't assume that just because we cycle and walk that we don't also drive.",-0.4,5.8
51,Do not take lanes from main arteries for bikes and pedestrians.,-0.8,0.8
52,"I suspect there will be many complaints from drivers about these changes, but I think part of that will be the result from misunderstandings - people who think these are permanent changes, especially. I really support and have benefited from this pilot project, but the execution has been confusing even for those of us who have followed its development - in terms of both how to use the lanes, how long they will be up, when they would roll out, etc.",-0.4,0.9
53,"If you want to make streets safe for bicycles, how about fixing their atrocious condition? It's called maintenance.",-0.4,0.9
54,Who reads these survey responses? What weight do the answers carry against ve$ted intere$t$? How do you get feedback from citizens without access to computers?,-0.2,0.6
55,This survey does not address automotive users that guarantees confirmation bias in the results. I've seen trump surveys that are less biased.,-0.4,0.8
56,This only helps able bodied people that already own a bike. Not everyone can ride a bike or can afford the expense of getting one. Over half the year it is too cold to rely on a bike. The city's maintenance with snow makes this a no go. Our streets are so poorly maintained for potholes as it is.,-0.5,2.9
57,Please please please make sure it is possible to safely exit the bike lane to the regular lane at any point in time / along the lane in case there is an obstruction in the lane. There needs to be adequate spacing between cones/barriers to exit the bike lane safely. This is also not ideal with the extra wide two-way lane on William; I perceive the bike lane on S 7th as much safer and am far more comfortable riding on S 7th despite the higher speed limit.,-0.3,1.1
58,"This is the dumbest idea ever and needs to be removed. This project is going to get people killed from the increased traffic and the poor integration of bike lanes with areas where cars will be turning. Also, this survey was poorly put together and worded in such a way as to only provide data which will support the argument that these are a good idea. It is embarrassing and whoever put it together should be ashamed.",-0.8,3.2
59,This has really made downtown feel more safe and welcoming. It makes me more likely to go downtown and less likely to drive. ,0.8,1.6
60,"Invest in a light rail system if you want to change things for the better for pedestrians, bikers, and emissions. This experiment has been a confusing, chaotic mess that has made commuting into Ann Arbor extremely unpleasant for those who have no other choice because the buses barely go anywhere and have terrible hours that don't cover hospitality or hospital workers. The only good thing has been the Main Street outdoor dining initiative. I've met literally nobody who likes all these street closures.",-0.4,1.8
61,"As much as I approve the Division/B-way improvements as a cyclist, it feels very awkward as a driver. And I will have to be a driver at least 7 months out of the year when it is cold and slippery!! I think this awkwardness will be better when the permanent structures are in place. But I hear from many residents (and experience myself) that Division is a real choke point for people getting to the Northside at peak commute times and there aren't alternatives other than Main/M-14 which are also parking lots during peak commute times. So, is there a way to make this a win-win??",-0.2,1.6

66,"I don't want to compete with cars in the road walking or riding on streets with multiple lanes 4 or more of car traffic. Separate bike paths are better and for dedicated space on roads such as 7th Street, there needs to be a safety barrier for bikes from cars, not plastic cones.",-0.5,1.1
67,"I didnt realize this project would close major roads like packard. Its ridiculous! Traffic is backed up forever on Packard, causing more people to cut through residential neighborhoods! And why on earth are the signs up in residential neighborhoods with wide streets and sidewalks???? Does the city need something to do, something to make them feel productive during this pandemic? Because this is a giant waste of resources and creates traffic congestion.",-0.5,3.5

70,"I'm not a fan of the aggressive reduction of car lanes in Ann Arbor. I bike, and I am a fan of bike lanes, but not when it takes roads to 1 lane, which in many of the ""healthy streets"" areas is the case. Half of the year, it's cold or snowing here. People need to be able to drive. During the COVID lockdown, traffic is reduced, but I can't imagine having Division St. down to a single lane for cars with normal traffic levels. Also, it seems like the city is prioritizing bike lane construction over the essential maintenance of roads. Many roads go neglected for years with dangerous (for cars and bikes) potholes, yet we seem to be considering elaborate bike highways. I prefer the city to prioritize resurfacing and maintaining the roads correctly. I've blown three tires and bent two wheels on my car in the past few years in Ann Arbor. I wouldn't ride my bike on many of our streets for this reason. Also, while biking certainly can help reduce carbon footprint, cars will soon be electric.",-0.2,4.2
71,Reducing to one lane for streets is absolutely horrible. Especially the busier ones like Packard. I also work for DoorDash and Postmates. The constant road closures and one lanes is making it harder for me to do my job in Ann Arbor. I do like on the weekends they have certain parts near main closed for outside dining. That makes complete sense but last night trying to navigate because of lanes closed and traffic was horrible. Are they going to fix the roads that are blocked off? Or are they just blocked off for bikers? I don't mind the bikes lanes that were actually physically made or sharing the road but seems absolutely ridiculous when Packard and other streets are busy and we can't use the other lane.,-0.3,4.5
72,"This is great! Keep up the good work. I would like to see more solutions like this that facility BOTH traffic flow of bikes/pedestrians and cars. Also, since Michigan is less bike friendly in the winter maybe this could be summer traffic flow meaning the patterns flex with the demand/season. Would like to see Main become permanently a pedestrian space on the weekends, like in Europe where there are steel pillars that raise and lower in the ground.",0.3,2.8
73,"Way to go, you've managed to take the danger and frustration of the bike lane at S 7th and Stadium and replicate it across the city. Cars turning right are crossing over the cyclists in the bike lane going straight. I was talking with a neighbor about our frustration of this new downtown scheme and she told me about a near collison she had at this intersection just yesterday. Plus, if you drive a motorcycle or bike, you're too light to trigger the traffic light and you get stuck at intersections waiting for a car to drive up and trigger the light. Then there's the new death defying turn at the top of Carey St where you have to make a sharp, uphill merge onto N Division. Now I have to weave between the large orange barrel and the pedestrian walkway marker to join traffic that has been narrowed to one lane. Someone's going to get hit here for sure. Again, this is too dangerous for motorcycles and scooters - now I'm driving my larger vehicle for safety.",-0.5,4.8

76,"I can hardly express my anger at this change. As far as ""healthy streets"" go, the exhaust emissions when cars back up for more than a half a mile at rush hour certainly don't qualify. To escape, cars go tearing through my neighborhood, where children play along the streets. The total mileage amassed on cars certainly increases, which is hardly a sustainable course. And as for me? Only at the lowesttraffic hours can I make a left turn out of my street (Easy Street). Even a right turn is a challenge.

Therefore biking or walking is out of the question. Finally, I would like to submit this comment: the project, at least on the southeast side, seems to be very ill conceived. Why spend precious city resources on a project that has no value-add? It is less safe for drivers, unnecessary for COVID social distancing, looks ugly, and is not well executed.

Many drivers might be visiting Ann Arbor and the setup is strange and confusing for them and local. Meanwhile, the only reason there is not currently major traffic jams and backups on Division is due to reduced commuters from Covid Work-from-homer's.
