While cycling on these I experienced people driving and parking in the separated bike lanes. It just looks like a convoluted, confusing construction zone.

10,Miller/Catherine - There are not clear directions on how transition from the bike lane west of first to the new pilot bike lane. Between Division and Fifth there are cars parked in the lane. State & North U - The road itself is in such a state of disrepair that it is very hard to ride a bike in this section.

11,"Make them permanent! Again, I can not stress enough how big of an improvement these bike lanes are over the previous car-centric lanes. Besides making them permanent, here are a few tweaks that might help: 1. Better signage for the south-bound lane on Division and the east-bound lane on Catherine. Since these lanes flow opposite traffic, better signage and traffic signals could improve safety for cyclists. 2. Larger barriers to prevent cars from entering the bike lanes to make right turns. I have seen this several times on Division. 3. A city-wide ban on ""right on red"" turns could help improve the safety of the bike lanes. 4. Remove the speed bumps in the bike lane on Division and instead install them on the car lanes 5. Anything that helps make this kind of installation permanent and normalizes cycling as a method of travel within the city is a step in the right direction!",0.1,3.0

Please make that happen! I'd probably advocate using more of the water-filled barriers to mark off the bike lanes on Division, Packard at Hill and State, and Miller/Catherine, rather than the construction barrels. It'd make it more clear that the lanes are not for cars and provide a larger barrier to cars going into the lanes. Having more signage on all of the bike lanes to make it clearer to delivery vehicles and others that there's a bike lane where a road or set of parking spaces used to be would be good as well.",-0.1,1.2

We sorely need a bike commuter friendly northsouth route and I appreciate this being provided via the Division St pilot. However having both biked and driven this route since its opening, I'm concerned that the primary danger to bikers -- turning cars -- is not really mitigated by the changes, which may come at a high cost of congestion over this route. As an alternative, it would be great to have a two-way bike lane on the east side of Division, with (red/green) turn arrows for the car traffic crossing this lane.

This is a busy stretch of road in a largely commercial area. To reduce traffic to one lane in each direction is ridiculous and, in my view, hazardous. I just spent 4 changes of traffic signals to get through the Packard/Platt intersection. I witnessed several near misses as frustrated drivers attempted to ""jump the line.""

58,Packard from Eisenhower to Platt is of great concern. Traffic going west in the morning is backed up as it is and this causes more congestion. One lane really? Traffic going east bound between Eisenhower and platt at 5 pm is horrific. People are flying down the middle lane To get to platt to turn left. Starting at Easy Street.

Division has very few cyclists and I've seen fewer since lanes were blocked. The connection to the bridge from Carey Street is confusing at best and now it's miserable.

There are already bike lanes along Packard. There isn't enough bike riders to justify the chaos. Bring back all bus routes to decrease traffic. As a handicap person, covid-19 AATA limited routes/stops have made taking a bus an impossibility. Coming into winter in 2 months, timing is stupid and the project poorly executed. With all budget shortfalls due to covid-19, is this really good use of funds we have left? Most people that work & support our city are being priced out of Ann Arbor & have to commute. Making people idle needlessly in traffic is going to negate what little benefit this brings. Make the bus routes not take an hour to get across town would do better.

Its becoming more attractive to move out of the city and pay lower taxes elsewhere since the commute time is now the same from out of town as it takes me to cross downtown. You are making traffic more congested and erratic, which is less safe for everyone. It feels like you're using COVID to justify a bike lane grab. One lane traffic makes it so difficult to turn left, backing up traffic, causing cars to peal off and zigzag through residential streets.

However, Division and South Main are your major traffic thoroughfares. If this were football season, you would be suffocating businesses. As is, you're severely limiting the desire of anyone that doesn't live downtown to patronize downtown establishments. By ruining your roads, you ruin your economy. Also, I'd argue that this creates a safety hazard because it routes more traffic from downtown to the north side of town past the hospital.

Through traffic is trapped behind the turners and sometimes the intersection at State and Packard is blocked.
